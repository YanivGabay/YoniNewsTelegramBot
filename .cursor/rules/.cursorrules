# YoniNewsTelegramBot Development Rules

## Core Principles
1. **No rush decisions** - Always understand the current logic before making changes
2. **Keep it simple** - Don't over-complicate solutions
3. **Confirm before changes** - Ask if logic is unclear
4. **Minimal documentation** - Code should be self-explanatory
5. **Separate concerns** - Keep utilities in separate files under src/

## Domain Rules
1. **Alerts from Pikud are ALWAYS Hebrew** - Never assume other languages
2. **Keep prompts in prompts.py** - Don't inline prompt text
4. **Test understanding first** - Read and understand existing code before modifying

## Code Organization
- src/ subdirectory
- Keep functions focused and simple
- Avoid complex inheritance or abstractions
- Use clear, descriptive names

## Before Making Changes
1. Read the relevant code sections
2. Understand the current flow
3. Identify the exact problem
5. Confirm approach if uncertain

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Changing multiple files at once without understanding
- Adding complex features when simple fixes work
- Over-documenting obvious code
- Making assumptions about data sources
